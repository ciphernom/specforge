# specforge
SpecForge is a sophisticated specification generation system that bridges the gap between natural language requirements and formal code specifications. It transforms high-level YAML-based descriptions into detailed, production-ready specifications that can be reliably consumed by Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate working code.
